Copy \IronSource\Plugins\Android\ and all it's contents to your assets folder to:

Assets\IronSource\Plugins\Android\

remove "-copyandremove" from IronSource.plugin and make sure it's listed to any platform
(it only applies for android anyway). Original IronSourceSDK looks into this path to find
the android manifest at this project library).
